# Bluetooth&reg; LE XENSIV&trade; Sensor Hub sensing service

This code example demonstrates the implementation of a custom Bluetooth&reg; LE sensing profile. It acquires data from the following sensors and transfers them over Bluetooth&reg; as notifications using AIROC&trade; CYW20829 Bluetooth&reg; LE MCU Evaluation Kit (EVK).

- XENSIV&trade; BGT60LTR11AIP radar sensor
- XENSIV&trade; PASCO2 carbon dioxide sensor
- XENSIV&trade; DPS368 barometric pressure sensor
- BMI270 IMU sensor
- BMM350 magnetometer sensor
- SHT35 relative humidity and temperature sensor

Infineon's Sensor Hub Android app can be used to connect to the EVK and display sensor data.

## Design and implementation


### Resources and settings

This section explains the ModusToolbox&trade; software resources and their configurations used in this code example. Note that all the configuration explained in this section has already been done in the code example. ModusToolbox&trade; software stores the device configuration settings of the application in the *design.modus* file and Bluetooth&reg; configuration settings of the application in the *design.cybt* file. This file uses the graphical configurators, which generate the configuration firmware. This firmware is stored in the application’s *GeneratedSource* folder.

- **Device Configurator:** Used to enable/configure the peripherals and the pins used in the application. For detailed information on how to use it, see the [Device Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxDeviceConfig).

- **Bluetooth&reg; Configurator:** Used for generating/modifying the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT database. For detailed information on how to use it, see the [Bluetooth&reg; Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxBLEConfig).

This application demonstrates the Bluetooth&reg; LE peripheral capability of the supported kit. The XENSIV&trade; Sensor Shield sensor values are sent over Bluetooth&reg; LE to a Central device (Infineon Sensor Hub mobile app), and to the UART as debug trace messages. This project demonstrates the following features:

- Bluetooth&reg; LE XENSIV&trade; Sensor Hub service – GATT Read and Notify functionality
- Debug trace messages
- Enabling of sensors through the terminal window via text input. 
- Connection with one Central device
- Connection status indication through LED

The project consists of the following files:

**Table 2. User-application-related source files**

**File name**|**Description**
-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------
*main.c* | Contains the `main()` function, which is the entry point for execution of the user application code after device startup.
*cycfg_bt_settings.c, cycfg_bt_settings.h* | Contains the runtime Bluetooth&reg; stack configuration parameters such as device name and advertisement/connection settings. Note that the name that the device uses for advertising (“sensorhub”) is defined in the *app_bt_cfg.c* file.
*app_bt_gatt_handler.c, app_bt_gatt_handler.h*| Contains the code for the Bluetooth&reg; stack GATT event handler functions.
*cycfg_gatt_db.c, cycfg_gatt_db.h*| Contains the GATT database information generated using the Bluetooth&reg; configurator tool. These files reside in the *GeneratedSource* folder under the application folder.
*uart.c, uart.h*| Contains code for initializing the UART peripheral configured using the Device Configurator tool.
*i2c.c, i2c.h*| Contains code for initializing the I2C peripheral using the HAL.
*bgt60ltr11_task.c, bgt60ltr11_task.h*| Contains code for initializing the XENSIV&trade; BGT60LTR11AIP sensor, and reading the `Target Detect` and `Phase Detect` pins to determine the presence of a target, and the direction of the target if they are approaching toward or departing from the radar.
*bmi270_task.c, bmi270_task.h*| Contains code for initializing the BMI270 sensor and reading the values to estimate the orientation of the board.
*bmm350_task.c, bmm350_task.h*| Contains code for initializing the BMM350 sensor and reading the x, y, z, and temperature values from the sensor.
*dps368_task.c, dps368_task.h*| Contains code for initializing the XENSIV&trade; DPS368 sensor and reading the pressure and temperature values of the sensor.
*pasco2_task.c, pasco2_task.h*| Contains code for initializing the XENSIV&trade; PASCO2 sensor and reading the CO2 values of the sensor.
*sht35_task.c, sht35_task.h*| Contains code for initializing the SHT35 sensor and reading the relative humidity, and temperature values of the sensor.
*console_task.c, console_task.h*| Contains code for printing the console menu and receiving text input to enable each sensor. This task alerts `sensors_task` once a sensor to be selected to be enabled either from the console input or from the Infineon Sensor Hub mobile app.

#### Flowchart

**Figure 17. Bluetooth&reg; LE XENSIV&trade; Sensor Hub service application**

<img src="./images/fig11.flowchart.png" alt="XENSIV&trade; Sensor hub - flowchart" height="800"/>

This flowchart provides an overview of the XENSIV&trade; Sensor Hub application. The XENSIV&trade; Sensor Hub sensing profile in this application consists of one of the Bluetooth&reg; SIG-defined services, namely the "XENSIV&trade; Sensor Shield" (XSS). This project implements custom characteristics for each sensor. These characteristics support notification and read operations, which allow the GATT Server to send data to the connected GATT Client device whenever new data is available, and a read to be performed from the GATT Client device, namely the Infineon Sensor Hub mobile app.

The Bluetooth&reg; Configurator provided by ModusToolbox&trade; makes it easier to design and implement the GATT DB. The Bluetooth&reg; Configurator generates the *cycfg_gatt_db.c* and *cycfg_gatt_db.h* files. All Custom Sensing profile-related variables and functions are contained in these files. When the GATT DB is initialized after Bluetooth&reg; stack initialization, all profile-related values will be ready to be advertised to the Central device. See the [ModusToolbox&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Configurator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxBLEConfig) for details.

The code example reads data from each sensor and prints these values to the terminal. If a Bluetooth&reg; connection is established with a GATT Client device and notifications are enabled, these sensors values are sent to the device.

When the Peripheral device is connected, the `USER LED2` will be ON; when it is disconnected but still advertising, the `USER LED2` will toggle; when it is disconnected and no longer advertising, the `USER LED2` will be OFF. To turn the LED ON and OFF, generic GPIO functions are used to drive the output pin HIGH or LOW. The LEDs present in the supported kits are active LOW LEDs, which means that the LED turns ON when the GPIO is driven LOW.

The *app_bt_gatt_handler.c* and *app_bt_gatt_handler.h* files handle the functionality of GATT callbacks from the Central device. On receiving a connection request, the Bluetooth&reg; stack gives a GATT event to the application of the `wiced_bt_gatt_evt_t` type.

In *cycfg_bt_settings.c,* all the runtime Bluetooth&reg; stack configuration parameters are defined; these will be initialized during Bluetooth&reg; stack initialization. Some of the configurations include the device name, connection interval, advertisement interval, advertisement channels to use, number of client connections, and maximum transmission unit (MTU). You also have the flexibility to configure the buffer pool size, which helps in optimizing the memory and transmission rate depending on the application use case.

The project also contains *app_bt_utils.c* and *app_bt_utils.h*, which provide APIs to see meaningful messages in debug logs in the debug UART. Most of the status messages in Bluetooth&reg; stack are represented in enumerated values. These functions allow you to view the respective strings instead of the enumerated values.

This application uses a modified *FreeRTOSConfig.h* file to work. Here, the `configTIMER_TASK_PRIORITY` is changed to *6* for the timer task and `configTIMER_TASK_STACK_DEPTH` is changed to *256*. In addition, two other minor modifications are made to the default *FreeRTOSConfig.h* file.
